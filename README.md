A bot I made for a friends discord server to play some youtube videos and do some minor server moderation.

<b> Commands: </b>

,ban 'phrase' - bans a phrase from being used

,limit 'limit' - sets the limit for the cleanse command

,ytadd 'name' 'link' - creates a new keyword that when typed will play that youtube video in the users channel
,ytremove 'name' - removes the keyword from the list
,skip - skips the currently playing track
,volume 'volume' - sets the volume to the number provided, range 0-100
,nameban @user - makes it so that all the users name changes are tracked and if a duplicate is found they are kicked
